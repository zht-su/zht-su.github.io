<h2 id="PI"> About Me </h2>

I got my Ph.D degree from Rutgers University at Newark in 2022 where my advisor was Prof. Xiaowei Wang. After that I am now a postdoc at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) where my mentor is Prof. Changzheng Li in the group of [GAGP](https://math.sysu.edu.cn/gagp/).

My research interest is in Kähler geometry, currently I am primarily focusing on Gamma conjecture I in mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology, as well as other questions in geometry, such as the question of embedding of manifolds, which is my main research topic during my Ph.D.
