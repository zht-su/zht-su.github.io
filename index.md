<h2 id="PI"> About Me </h2>

I got my Ph.D degree from Rutgers University at Newark in 2022 where my advisor was Prof. Xiaowei Wang. After that I am now a postdoc at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) where my mentor is Prof. Changzheng Li in the group of [GAGP](https://math.sysu.edu.cn/gagp/). I got my bechelor degree from Lanzhou University in 2016.

My research interest lies in Kähler geometry. Currently, I am primarily focused on the Gamma Conjecture I in mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology, as well as other topics in geometry, such as the embedding of manifolds, which was my main research topic during my Ph.D.
